# Validators

Validators secure the relay chain by staking EDG, validating blocks from and participating in consensus with other validators.. 

Validators perform two functions. First, verifying that the information contained in an assigned set of blocks is valid \(such as the identities of the transacting parties and the subject matter of the contract\). Their second role is to participate in the consensus mechanism to produce the Chain blocks based on validity statements from other validators.

 Any instances of non-compliance with the consensus algorithms result in punishment by removal of some or all of the validatorâ€™s staked EDGs, thereby discouraging bad actors. Good performance, however, will be rewarded, with validators receiving block rewards \(including transaction fees\) in the form of DOTs in exchange for their activities.
