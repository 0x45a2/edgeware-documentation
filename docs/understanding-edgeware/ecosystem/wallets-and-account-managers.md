# Wallets and Account Managers

### Core Developer Wallets

*  [**Commonwealth.im**](http://commonwealth.im/) **\(Signup in right top side, must connect EDG address\)** 
  * At this time,  **the wallet is under development**. It supports viewing balances, sending and receiving transactions, and governance actions via the Commonwealth.im UI. The public addresses shown do not display the Edgeware network ID-encoded version at this time, but this feature is due by end-of-launch-week. You should regenerate your public address using the link below.

* [**Polkadot JS Browser Extension** ](https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension)**\(**[**Chrome**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/polkadot%7Bjs%7D-extension/mopnmbcafieddcagagdcbnhejhlodfdd) **and** [**Firefox**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polkadot-js-extension/)**\)**  
  * Can be used to connect EDG addresses to Commonwealth.im. \(This is the Official Polkadot Wallet Extension\)
  * Supports the most features via[ the Polkadot UI.](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer)
  * The Polkadot.js Browser Extension **does not display the Edgeware network ID encoded at this time.** The public address of your EDG wallet shown in the extension is encoded using the 'default network ID' of Subkey, the program that generates keypairs for Substrate-based chains. As a result, the public addresses shown may not be useful for using block explorers. You should regenerate your public key to derive the Edgeware network-ID-encoded public address, see above.
