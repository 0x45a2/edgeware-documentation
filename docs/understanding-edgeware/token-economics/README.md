# Token Economics



### Supply

There are initially 5,000,000,000 \(five billion\) EDG tokens minted, divisible up to 18 decimal places. Initially, inflation is set to 158 EDG per block. This implies approximately 997,220,160 EDG in the first year, or just under 20% inflation. 

The total amount of EDG minted will remain the same year after year, causing the percentage inflation to be disinflationary, with yearly inflation falling to approximately 16.6% in the second year. Additionally, a system-wide vote may further increase or decrease inflation. 

One of the first proposals on Edgeware will be to tie inflation to a specific participation or security rate, with the inflation floating up or down to reach a desired total stake. The specified proposal will be voted on and performed via a runtime upgrade modifying the inflation rate. 

### Token Uses

On Edgeware, EDG has multiple functions. EDG entitles holders both staking and voting rights, as well as the ability to delegate this right to another account. EDG is also used to pay for state changes within the Wasm smart contract module
