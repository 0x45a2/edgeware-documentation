# Treasury Module

While validators are often the only stakeholder natively incentivized in other blockchains, Edgeware proposes to use the block reward to incentivize all stakeholders. Block inflation will be allocated token towards an on-chain treasury, 14 which will be allocated by specific treasury proposals. Initially, the on-chain treasury will be funded by 50% of the block reward. Edgeware tokenholders may allocate funds to: 

• Core Technology: Implementing of scaling technologies such as runtime improvements, sharding, and off-chain extensions. 

• Governance: Governance systems, including on-chain identity as well as tools for organizing and coordinating the work of core developers. 

• Developer experience: A mature toolchain for developing, debugging, and testing smart contracts. 

• User experience: Wallets and user experience primitives \(e.g., JavaScript libraries\) to make decentralized apps simple and easy to use. • Ecosystem support: Engaging developers, end users, and other stakeholders through in-person events.
