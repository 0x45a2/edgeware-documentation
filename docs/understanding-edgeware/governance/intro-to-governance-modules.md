# Intro to Governance Modules

 The core functionality of Edgeware’s governance is implemented in several extensible modules: 

#### Signaling

 Non-binding polls are an important part of the governance process for existing blockchains. Users should also be able to create and distribute polls for signaling interest in different proposals, strategies, and directions. 

#### Identity

 Edgeware requires a first-class identity primitive so people can identify each other in the governance process.

#### Democracy:

 The democracy module initially restricts votes on proposals to binary votes. This module allows for delegated voting–improving the total stake allocated towards a vote. Future upgrades should allows users to choose between many different methods for voting on a proposal \(e.g., binary or rank-choice\). 

#### Council: 

Edgeware allows voters to nominate a set of accounts that hold certain rights over the network. Council members can bias proposals. 

#### Treasury: 

This module allows individuals to vote on the allocation of a portion of newly minted EDG.
