# Signaling

The signaling module allows users to vote to create non-binding polls. Non-binding polls are an important part of the governance process for existing 10 blockchains and have been administered previously in an ad-hoc manner. 

Users should natively be able to create and distribute polls for signaling interest in different proposals, strategies, and directions. Individuals can choose between many different methods for voting on a proposal \(e.g., binary or ranked choice\) and moreover allows for delegated votingâ€“improving the total stake allocated towards a vote. Once a direction has been chosen, the council or the democracy module can create a binding on-chain referendum.
