## Why should I validate on Edgeware?

Edgeware is a proof-of-stake network, which requires Validators to ensure transactions are well-formed and to provide security on Edgeware.

Validators also earn fees from both the block reward and transactions. Earned tokens can then be used to influence further governance decisions on the network.
