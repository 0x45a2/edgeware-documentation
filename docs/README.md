## What is Edgeware?

[**Edgeware**](https://edgewa.re/) is an:

* On-chain Governed,
* Nominated Proof-of-Stake \(PoS\) Blockchain
* Smart Contract Platform
* with a WASM \(WebAssembly\) Runtime through Parity Substrate.

It is designed to apply decision-making process to the runtime of the blockchain, but also to the decision-making processes themselves, in an effort to rapidly generate more effective governance solutions for blockchain platforms.

Participants in Edgeware vote, delegate, and fund each other to upgrade the network.

Edgeware users value the platform for its commitment and potential to fulfill more decentralized and user-owned blockchain platforms, both for the governance mechanisms as well as its unique token distribution mechanism, the lockdrop, which distributes tokens more fairly in order to achieve more effective and representative governance.

Edgeware is within the Polkadot Ecosystem.

**This site,** the Edgeware Documentation, aims to become a community-developed resource for the use, validation, development on, and management of the Edgeware smart contract platform.
